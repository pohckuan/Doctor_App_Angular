# Doctor_App_Angular

Aceso is a doctor searching application that allows users to search by keywords related to the doctors. Users can also provide reviews on the doctors.

A user should be able to sort by keywords related to the doctor.
As a user I should be able to view a specific doctor's information, e.g. school, speciality, 
and reviews. 
A user can add,read, edit and delete a review.

Technologies: 

1.API was built in with rails and deployed on heroku to serve as the back-end.
2. ngResources was the bridge we used to connect the Angular front-end and the rails back-end. 
3. Doctors and Reviews Factories were created to display the doctors' information and their reviews.
